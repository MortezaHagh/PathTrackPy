# path_tracking_py pkg

Path tracking methods implemented in Python.

## Two Implementation

1. In ROS framework (for real applications or 3D simulation with Gazebo)
2. In Python (2D simulation robot as a point)

For now the referecnce plans are saved and parsed as JSON file. The action implementation will be added.

## Three path teacking methods

1. Pure Pursuit
2. Model Predictive Control: MPC
3. Linear Quadratic Regulator:LQR

## Running

Running 3D simulation in ROS:



Running 2D simulation:

``` 
python3 scripts/tracking.py
```
